Physical space vs Grid space
----------------------------

In ``exaStamp``, all the operations concerning parallelism are actually done in a denominated **Grid space** which is fully defined by the ``domain`` operator described hereafter. Before going into details about this operator, we need to describe how the simulation domain is defined. The 3D simulation box can be represented by its **3x3** frame matrix :math:`\mathbf{H_P}` (with the subscript :math:`(\cdot)_P` for physical space) built on the 3 periodicity vectors :math:`\mathbf{a}`, :math:`\mathbf{b}` and :math:`\mathbf{c}`:

.. math::

   \mathbf{H_P} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{a} | \mathbf{b} | \mathbf{c} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a_x & b_x & c_x \\ a_y & b_y & c_y \\ a_z & b_z & c_z\end{pmatrix}

without any constraints on the periodicity vectors :math:`\mathbf{a}`, :math:`\mathbf{b}` and :math:`\mathbf{c}` w.r.t the orthonormal frame. From this, we assume that the :math:`\mathbf{H_P}` matrix can be decomposed as:

.. math::

   \mathbf{H_P} = \mathbf{F_1} \cdot \mathbf{D} = \mathbf{F_1} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} || \mathbf{a} || & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & || \mathbf{b} || & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & || \mathbf{c} || \end{pmatrix}

where :math:`\mathbf{D}` is a diagonal matrix with components equal to the norm of each periodicity vector and :math:`\mathbf{F_1}` a transformation matrix that allows to transform the general (triclinic) physical domain to a pure orthorhombic unphysical one. :math:`\mathbf{F_1}` can be trivially calculated as:

.. math::

   \mathbf{F_1} = \mathbf{H_P} \cdot \mathbf{D}^{-1} = \mathbf{H_P} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{ || \mathbf{a} || } & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{|| \mathbf{b} ||} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{ || \mathbf{c} || } \end{pmatrix}

In the Grid space, the domain needs to be defined through a diagonal matrix :math:`\mathbf{H_G}` (with the subscript :math:`(\cdot)_G` for grid space) where each diagonal component equals an integer multiple :math:`(n_x, n_y, n_z)`  of the cell_size :math:`c_s`:

.. math::

   \mathbf{H_G} = \begin{pmatrix} n_x \cdot c_s & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & n_y \cdot c_s & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & n_z \cdot c_s \end{pmatrix}

Finally, both physical space and grid space meet through the following equality:

.. math::

   \mathbf{H_G} = \mathbf{X_f} \cdot \mathbf{H_P}

which adds an additional constraint on the compatibility between the physical space and grid space. Indeed, for the compatibility to be satisfied, the diagonal matrix :math:`mathbf{D}` is mapped to the :math:`\mathbf{H_G}` matrix through the following operation:

.. math::

   \mathbf{D} = \mathbf{F_2} \cdot \mathbf{H_G}

leading to:

.. math::

   \mathbf{F_2} = \mathbf{D} \cdot \mathbf{H_G}^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{||\mathbf{a}||}{n_x \cdot c_s} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{||\mathbf{b}||}{n_y \cdot c_s} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \frac{||\mathbf{c}||}{n_z \cdot c_s} \end{pmatrix}

where :math:`(n_x,n_y,n_z)` and :math:`c_s` are fixed by the user as explained hereafter. If the user requires a specific cell size :math:`c_s`, then the number of cells and the appropriate :math:`\mathbf{X_f}` are automatically calculated and vice versa. The final expression of the :math:`\mathbf{X_f}` reads:

.. math::

   \mathbf{X_f} = \mathbf{F_1} \cdot \mathbf{F_2} = \mathbf{H_P} \cdot \mathbf{D}^{-1} \cdot \mathbf{D} \cdot \mathbf{H_G}^{-1} 

which simplifies to:

.. math::

   \mathbf{X_f} = \mathbf{H_P} \cdot \mathbf{H_G}^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{a} | \mathbf{b} | \mathbf{c} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a_x & b_x & c_x \\ a_y & b_y & c_y \\ a_z & b_z & c_z\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} n_x \cdot c_s & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & n_y \cdot c_s & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & n_z \cdot c_s \end{pmatrix}^{-1}

which can lead to very simple expression of :math:`\mathbf{X_f}` when for example the physical domain is a cubic domain with lengths exactly set to a multiple of cell size. The next section explains in detail how to fully define the domain.

Defining the domain
-------------------

The ``domain`` operator
***********************

The ``domain`` operator allows to fully define the simulation domain as follows:
   
.. code-block:: yaml

   domain:
     cell_size: 5.0 ang
     grid_dims: [20,20,20]
     bounds: [[0 ang ,0 ang,0 ang],[100 ang, 100 ang, 100 ang]]
     xform: [[1.,0.,0.],[0.,1.,0.],[0.,0.,1.]]
     periodic: [true,true,true]
     expandable: false

where all properties of the ``domain`` block are described below.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description
     - Data Type
     - Default
   * - ``cell_size``
     - Grid cell size in grid space.
     - float
     - 0.
   * - ``grid_dims``
     - 3D Grid dimensions.
     - IJK
     - [0,0,0]
   * - ``bounds``
     - Domain bounds in grid space.
     - AABB
     - [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
   * - ``xform``
     - Grid space to real space transformation matrix.
     - Mat3d
     - [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
   * - ``periodic``
     - Periodic boundary conditions.
     - sequence
     - [true, true, false]
   * - ``mirror``
     - Mirror boundary conditions.
     - sequence
     - []
   * - ``expandable``
     - Domain expandability.
     - bool
     - true

.. warning::

   When defining the simulation domain through this operator, all properties must be consistent with each other. In particular, ``cell_size`` multiplied by ``grid_dims`` must be equal to max(``bounds``) - min(``bounds``).

Usage examples
**************
  
Multiple examples of domain definitions are provided below with, for each case, an example of the ``domain`` YAML block, a visualization of the physical space and another visualization of the grid space.

Cubic domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first example creates a cubic physical domain with 100 :math:`\AA` side length, with 20 cells in each direction. In grid space, the domain also is cubic with the same dimensions.

.. code-block:: YAML

   domain:
     cell_size: 5.0 ang
     grid_dims: [20,20,20]
     bounds: [[0 ang ,0 ang,0 ang],[100 ang, 100 ang, 100 ang]]
     xform: [[1.,0.,0.],[0.,1.,0.],[0.,0.,1.]]
     periodic: [true,true,true]
     expandable: false   

In that case, the :math:`\mathbf{X_f}` matrix equal the identity matrix and the grid space domain is exactly equal to the physical space domain. Below are displayed the 3D physical (left) and grid (right) domains look like:

.. figure:: /_static/cubic_both_spaces.png
   :width: 600pt
   :align: center
                 
Orthorhombic domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In that second example, an orthorhombic physical domain with 80 :math:`\AA`, 100 :math:`\AA` and 120 :math:`\AA` side lengths is created, with 16, 20 and 25 cells in each direction. In grid space, the domain is also orthorhombic with the same dimensions since the physical size exactly equals a finite number of cells in each direction.

.. code-block:: yaml
     
   # 1st solution
   domain:
     cell_size: 5.0 ang
     grid_dims: [16,20,24]
     bounds: [[0 ang ,0 ang,0 ang],[80 ang, 100 ang, 120 ang]]
     xform: [[1.,0.,0.],[0.,1.,0.],[0.,0.,1.]]
     periodic: [true,true,true]
     expandable: false
  
As before, since the physical domain exactly equals (in each direction), a finite number of cells, the grid domain has the exact same dimensions.

.. figure:: /_static/ortho1_both_spaces.png
   :width: 600pt
   :align: center

If for some reasons the user needs to have the same grid dimensions in each direction, it is possible to define an orthorhombic physical domain by modifying the :math:`\mathbf{X_f}` matrix as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # 2nd solution
   domain:
     cell_size: 5.0 ang
     grid_dims: [20,20,20]
     bounds: [[0 ang ,0 ang,0 ang],[100 ang, 100 ang, 100 ang]]
     xform: [[0.8,0.,0.],[0.,1.,0.],[0.,0.,1.2]]
     periodic: [true,true,true]
     expandable: false
  
This way, the physical domain has the exact same dimensions as before, but the grid domain is now cubic with 20 cells in each direction.

.. figure:: /_static/ortho2_both_spaces.png
   :width: 600pt
   :align: center
   
Restricted triclinic domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                 
.. code-block:: yaml
                 
   # 1st solution: restricted triclinic
   # (e.g. **a** is parallel to x and
   # **b** is in the (x,y) plane)
   domain:
     cell_size: 5.0 ang
     grid_dims: [20,20,20]
     bounds: [[0 ang ,0 ang,0 ang],[100 ang, 100 ang, 100 ang]]
     xform: [[1.,0.1,0.2],[0.,1.,0.2],[0.,0.,1.]]
     periodic: [true,true,true]
     expandable: false

.. figure:: /_static/restricted_tri_both_spaces.png
   :width: 600pt
   :align: center
                 
Generalized triclinic domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: yaml
                 
   # 2nd solution: general triclinic
   # (e.g. no constraints on **a** or **b**)          
   domain:
     cell_size: 5.0 ang
     grid_dims: [20,20,20]
     bounds: [[0 ang ,0 ang,0 ang],[100 ang, 100 ang, 100 ang]]
     xform: [[1.,0.05,0.1],[0.05,1.,0.1],[0.1,0.1,1.2]]
     periodic: [true,true,true]
     expandable: false

.. figure:: /_static/generalized_tri_both_spaces.png
   :width: 600pt
   :align: center
                                  
Alternative ways for defining the domain
----------------------------------------

The ``domain_from_lengths_angles`` operator
*******************************************

Built-in particles creators
***************************

External file readers
*********************

In some cases, the simulation domain does not need to be fully defined as explained above. Indeed, the domain information can sometimes already be contained in external files or fully defined by the material the user needs to model. Below is a list of situations where the domain is fully or partially defined. Additional details can be found in the corresponding documentation sections.

- ``bulk_lattice``: The system shape and size is created according to the replication in the 3D space of a unit cell chosen by the user. See :ref:`input-bulk-lattice`.
- ``read_xyz_file_with_xform``: Instead of creating the system from a template, an external ``.xyz`` file is read in which the number of atoms, their positions and the simulation cell size and shape ir provided. In that case, only the ``cell_size`` property of the ``domain`` YAML block is needed. See :ref:`input-read-xyz-xform`.
- ``read_dump_atoms``: The simulation starts at a specific timestep for which a restart file was generated. That restart files usually contains all information for the simulation domain. See :ref:`input-read-dump-atoms`.
- ``read_dump_molecule``: Same as above but for flexible molecules. See :ref:`input-read-dump-mol`.
- ``read_dump_rigidmol``: Same as above but for rigid molecules. See :ref:`input-read-dump-rigidmol`.
