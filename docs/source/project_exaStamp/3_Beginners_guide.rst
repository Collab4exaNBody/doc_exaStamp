Beginner's guide to exaStamp
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

This section aims at providing a step-by-step tutorial on how to create and design a classical molecular dynamics simulation using ``exaStamp``. The application takes advantage of YAML and can be fully defined using a combination of YAML nodes that act as individual operators. This allows a fine customization of the simulation by the user. Default configuration files are located in ``exaStamp/data/config`` and the basic ones are explained below.
