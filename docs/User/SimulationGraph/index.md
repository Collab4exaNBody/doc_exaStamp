# **Understanding the simulation's graph**

This part of the documentation is dedicated to the **exaStamp** simulation graph and default configuration of its constitutive elements. Indeed, the entire simulation workflow is defined by a combination of operators that can be interconnected, each of which can expect some data as input and generate data as output.

The default simulation graph of an **exaStamp** simulation is defined in `data/config/main-config.msp`. `data/config` also contains a bunch of configuration files that can be included in your simulation's input file. The `YAML` format is the only input format supported by **exaStamp** and we recall its basis as well as some extensions developed in the context of the onika/exaNBody HPC platform.

Below are links (you can also access them using the left table of contents) yo the subparts of the present section:

- [**Default configuration**](DefaultYAML.md)
