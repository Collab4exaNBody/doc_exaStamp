# Tutorials

This section aims at providing step-by-step tutorials on how to create and design a classical molecular dynamics simulation using ``exaStamp``. The application takes advantage of YAML and can be fully defined using a combination of YAML nodes that act as individual operators. This allows a fine customization of the simulation by the user. Default configuration files are located in ``exaStamp/data/config`` and the basic ones are explained below.

Below are direct links and short explanation of the available tutorials:

- [**Simple NVE simulation using an EAM potential**](tutorial1.md)
- [**Rigid H2O molecule**](tutorial2.md)
- [**Piston shock simulation*](tutorial3.md)
