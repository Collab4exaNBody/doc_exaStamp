# Cahn-Hilliard

Verification of the Cahn-Hilliard equations is made with the following tests:

- Coalescence of two kissing bubbles (see [Example 1](example1/index.md))
- Square bubble (see [Example 2](example2/index.md))
- Spinodal decomposition (see [Example 3](example3/index.md))
- Manufactured Cahn-Hilliard Solution (see [Example 4](example4/index.md))
- Analytical steady solution (see [Example 5](example5/index.md))
