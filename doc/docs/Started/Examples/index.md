This page describes the tests that are relevant for performing multiphysics simulations. 

These tests are naturally grouped into the following categories:

- [Cahn-Hilliard](CahnHilliard/index.md) 
- [Allen-Cahn](AllenCahn/index.md)
- [Mass Diffusion](MassDiffusion/index.md)
- [Thermal Diffusion](ThermalDiffusion/index.md)
- [CALPHAD](Calphad/index.md)


They are continuously run during the `SLOTH` continuous integration process to detect code regressions early while maintaining high code coverage.
