Introduction to ExaSTAMP
========================

ExaSTAMP stands for "Simulations Temporelles Atomistiques et Moléculaires en Parallèle à l'Exascale" or Exascale Atomistic and Molecular Simulations in Parallel.

ExaSTAMP is a classical molecular dynamics simulation code dedicated to the modeing of materials behavior at extreme conditions. The code integrates in the ExaNBody platform and is specifically designed to run on HPC platforms. It beneficiates from MPI + OpenMP parallelization as well as from GPU acceleration features. The code is developed at the Military Division of the French Atomic Energy Commision (CEA DAM DIF). ExaSTAMP is an open-source software distributed under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0.

Various informations can be found on this documentation. The latter includes an installation guide, some test-cases examples, a list of available plugins and a full list of operators that can be used to build input decks for highly modulable simulation scenarios.
